Application Explanation:

This application allows the user to use node command line arguments to bring up data about songs, concert events, and movies. It uses four functions; one for each type of data and a user default function. To use the application you simpily call one of the four commands and then follow with a search string. 

The four commands are as follows:
1. concert-this

2. spotify-this-song

3. movie-this

4. do-what-it-says

The application then returns the appropriate data and prints it to the console and also a .txt file.
